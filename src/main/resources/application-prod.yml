#  Choose the profile in different ways

#  docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev -e DB_PASSWORD=devpassword your-spring-app
#  Spring Boot will look for a file named application-dev.properties (or application-dev.yml) in addition to the default application.properties
#  Spring Boot merges the properties from the default application.properties and the profile-specific application-dev.properties.
#  If there are overlapping properties, the profile-specific values will take precedence.
#  -e DB_PASSWORD=devpassword This will override the db.password property in your configuration files, regardless of whether it is defined in application.properties or application-dev.properties.
